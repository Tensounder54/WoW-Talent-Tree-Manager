# WoW Talent Tree Manager
## What is the WoW Talent Tree Manager?
For the return of talent trees in the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion Dragonflight, this project aims to give players the possibility to easily create, change and share talent tree setups for all classes and even create completely new and custom talent trees for fun. It does provide a simple and clean interface to make the exploration of new talent setups as smooth as possible.

## Feedback & Contribution
Since this is currently a solo project there will be some rough edges, issues and bugs as well as features that might be missing or aren't well thought out. You can provide TTM feedback via Discord ("About" tab in program for more details) and via issues here on Github.
Additionally, if you want to contribute (there's a lot of code cleanup and extension to do) then you are more than welcome to do so.
