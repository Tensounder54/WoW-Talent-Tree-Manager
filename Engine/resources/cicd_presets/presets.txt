1.3.8:custom:0:New custom Tree:Welcome to WoW Talent Tree Manager.__n__This is a solution to manage trees and their loadouts. A loadout is a collection of skillsets, __n__e.g. a skillset for Raid/M+/PvP etc. You can edit trees or work with spec presets, manage __n__various skillsets in your loadout as well as auto solve all possible skill combinations with a __n__given filter.__n____n__Edit the tree name/description here. To edit tree nodes select "Tree Editor" in the top right.__n__Press "Save/Load Trees" to load tree spec presets, manage your custom trees and import or__n__export trees (from/to Discord, etc.).__n__To start the tree editing process, go to "Tree Editor" -> "Create Node" and create your first__n__talent.__n____n__Select the "Talent Loadout Editor" in the top left to manage your loadout. You can __n__edit the loadout description there and create/import/export skillsets. Since skillsets are stored__n__inside the loadout which is part of the tree, you can save your skillsets by saving the tree__n__in the tree editor.__n____n__Lastly, select the "Talent Loadout Solver" to generate all possible combinations of talent__n__selections for all possible amounts of spendable talent points. Afterwards, you can filter__n__the results to include/exclude specific talents and load the results into your loadout.__n____n__Hint__cl__ This text can be edited!:Your loadout is a collection of different skillset that you can edit to suit various ingame __n__situations, e.g. a raid setup, an M+ setup or different PvP skillsets.__n__All skillsets are stored in the loadout which in turn is stored in the tree. So if you save your tree__n__you'll save your loadout as well! Additionally, you can import/export skillsets directly, to share__n__with friends or your favorite discord class experts.:0:0;
