# Data Management

This folder contains scripts that handle ETL tasks for serving data of the desktop client engine in the web version.
This includes:

- Extract icons of the packed icon file to the public directory of the web app
- Update database talent tree presets based on the talent preset file that is already scraped for the desktop version
- Create popular build presets for all specs (soon)
